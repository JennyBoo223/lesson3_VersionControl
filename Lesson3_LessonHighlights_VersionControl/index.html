            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is what records the changes to a certain file over time so that you can go back Being able to look back at a previous file in a previous state is very important for graphic or web designers. It allows developers to track changes, go back to an older version of a file, see who was last to modify a certain file, and much more. Local Version Control Systems copy the files into a directory. This system is error prone because people can forget what directory they are in and can accidently copy over the wrong files. Centralized Version Control Systems allow people to work with other developers that are working on other systems. One down fall to CVCS is that if the server goes down, no one can work on any versions. Distributed Version Control Systems is an exact image of the repository. So if the server goes out, the clients repositories can be used as a back up.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Linux kernel is a project that allows open source work. By 2002, a Distributed Version Control System called BitKeeper was being used. In 2005, the Linux kernel community and the BitKeeper company broke apart with the free-of-charge status taken away. Because Linux is all about open source, they wanted to develop their own Distributed Version Control System based off of the things that they had learned while working with BitKeeper. Goals for this new system included speed, simple design, support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle bigger projects. This new DVCS was called Git and has grown to be easy to use and works very fast.

                <span class="text-muted">Git 101</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git does not store its information as a list of file-based changes like other Version Control Systems. Instead, Git thinks of storing data as a series of snapshots in its file system. Most of the operations used in Git only needs access to local files to work. This helps Git work fast because the whole history of your project is on your local disk. And unlike other VCS, Git can be used offline because most of the files are local. There are three stages that a file can be in: committed, modified, and staged. Modified means you have changed the file but have not committed it to the database. Staged means you have a modified file to go into your commit snapshot. The Git directory stores the data for a project. The working directory lets you check out one version of the project. The staging area is usually a file within your Git directory and records info about what is going into the next commit.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to get a Git Repository. The first way takes an existing project and imports that into Git. To get the project’s directory you type “git init”. This will create a subdirectory called “.git” and conations all of our repository files. To start version controlling, you must use the “git add” command followed by the “git commit” command. The second way to get a Git Repository is to clone an existing repository. To do this, you type “git clone [url]”. This will make a directory with a .git directory inside of it. The data is pulled down and a working copy of the latest version is checked out.

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To check the status of your files, you use the command “git status”. This command allows you to see the status of your files such as if they are tracked or untracked. To track a currently untracked file, you use the command “git add [filename]”. You can then fun git status to see that your file is now tracked. It is important to note that if you make a change on a file, you must stage it again with the “git add” command so that the latest version of the file is staged. To see what you have changed but not staged yet you use the command “git diff”. To see what is staged and will go into the next commit you use the command “git diff - -staged”. Lastly, to commit your changes, you use the command “git commit” which will record a snapshot of your project that you can go back to look at or change.
